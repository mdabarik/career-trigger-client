// If you want completely free and ready‑to‑use with toolbar → Quill.js is the easiest choice.

// If you want enterprise features (collaboration, export, etc.) → TinyMCE or CKEditor (free to start, paid for advanced).

// If you want maximum customization → Tiptap, Slate, or Draft.js  (all free, but you build the toolbar yourself).
